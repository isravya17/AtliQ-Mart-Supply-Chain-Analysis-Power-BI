## Problem statement

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend the annual contract due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘on-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’ and OnTime in full (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

**Task List**

Peter Pandey is the data analyst in the supply chain team who joined Atliq Mart recently. He has been briefed about the task in the stakeholder business review meeting. Now Imagine yourself as Peter Pandey and play the role of the new data analyst who is excited to build this dashboard and perform the following task

Create the metrics according to the metrics list. Create a dashboard according to the requirements provided by stakeholders in the business review meeting. You will be provided with the transcript of this business review meeting in the form of a comic. Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/stakeholder meeting.

## Data Model

## Dashboard

## Insights from Dashboard
  - Key Metrics (OT%, IF%, OTIF%) are significantly below the target.  
  - On average, orders are delivered 0.42 days later than the agreed delivery date.  
  - Lotus Mart, Coolblue, and Acclaimed Stores have the highest order volumes and also face the most delays in timely deliveries.  
  - Could inaccurate delivery date estimations be causing these delays?  
  - Are we receiving more orders than anticipated?  
  - Ghee, curd, and butter are the most delayed product categories.  
  - There have been no significant improvements in any key metrics over the past few months.  
  - A substantial gap in IF% is observed for most customers. Could this be due to insufficient production?
